Welcome 
Hello traveler, you've entered the lands of Amber, welcome to my little corner of the internet!
This website is sort of a mix between a scrapbook and a portfolio of projects i've started (not necessarily ended though). This place is a love letter to the personal web, a castle of golden memories. A museum dedicated to preserving, the little things left in the margins.

I update semi-regularly so if you enjoy these lands please come back.

Warning: there are hidden wonders around!
almost evereything in here is clickable, there are many secrets to be found

this web is still being woven, please don't be surprised if it changes from time to time
