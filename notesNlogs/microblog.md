- 12 mar 2025 21:40: i just came back from a friend's house and i never had a more fun d&d session. we're playing a side quest where we're catapulted in a fantasy world and we have to guess our class and stats based on clues we get exploring and we've been straight up laughing for four hours. we never had so much collaboration and shenanigans at the table and i really hope the vibes stay like this next week!
