Lately i've been into medieval revival and whimsiogoth style. I'm also a big fantasy lover and an avid d&d player. I love making maps, minis and props to give to my friends and somehow i'm always the unofficial note-taker.

What does the creature do with itself?
Keep her hands occupied. That's the main thing about me, if i'm not doing something with my hands i will go insane. I'm a hobby collector as they say, i've tried many and i'm looking to try even more. 
Favourite hobbies: traditional and digital art, pyrography, bookbinding, embridery, knitting, sewing, nail art, hairstyling, webkeeping, scrapbooking, prop building and many more
Hobbies on my bucket list: goldsmithing, mosaic, stained glass, pottery, 3d modeling

	Music: Lungs by Florence & The Machine
