                            This book is making me crAZY. The writing! The premise! The yearniNGGG!! These two women are driving me INSANE. Truly the best space lesbians since Gideon and Harrow. Lord I wish i could eat the letters like those damn berries. Munch. I'm going to preach about this book like it's the fucking bible. I wish I could write letters like that. It's not me being metaphorical, I devoured this, ink and all. Delicious.

                            A Discworld book is always like a nice blanket for me. Pratchett is so funny, and this story was so sweet; I really loved it.

                            This book was really challenging for me because the setting was very bleak, the plot sad and the characters terrible. But the writing is amazing as always, Moshfegh never disappoints.

                            It's been a few years of me reading a Witcher book on the 2nd of January, first book fo the new year. I love it because it's the type of fantasy that's very comforting for me, and i relly like Geralt, he's one of my favourite poor little meow meows. This one was nice but a little scarce in plot, a lot of traveling in the woods. Still nice though.
