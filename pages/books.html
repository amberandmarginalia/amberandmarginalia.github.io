                            The most irritating main character I've ever read. I can excuse an unreliable narrator with delusions of grandeur but i draw the line at being annoying. Apart from that it's a great book, well written and with decent worldbuilding. I'm gonna read the next one anyway.

                            An epic, personal odissey of three, very interesting characters. I absolutely love Shafak's style, every sentence was fluid, liquid; her prose, crystal clear and refreshing. I felt like i was drinking, not reading it.

                            Very interesting and informative, even if i don't know how the author got so many personal info about scientists. Still i loved the writing style. Also reading about quantum physics on public transport definetly made me feel amazing about myself.

                            Gripped me from start to finish. Akabar's writing style is so captivating to me, even prose feels like a poem, lyrical. Every character is complex and three-dimensional and just so interesting. And the structure, alternating povs and timey whimey? Amazing. Literary fiction at its best.

                            I got tricked byt the title because i thought that it was going to be a funny, witty Pratchet/Adams sort of genre comedy but it was definetly not. Gave up after 50 pages.

                            The put together version of my year of rest and relaxation. A truly delightful read, even though i was green with envy the whole time. This was a heartwarming memoir and i especially loved the way Giuffre described her children, it's refreshing to see someone letting kids be kids. I recommend this to people who want a village: this is how you can become a villager and create community.

                            This book is making me crAZY. The writing! The premise! The yearniNGGG!! These two women are driving me INSANE. Truly the best space lesbians since Gideon and Harrow. Lord I wish i could eat the letters like those damn berries. Munch. I'm going to preach about this book like it's the fucking bible. I wish I could write letters like that. It's not me being metaphorical, I devoured this, ink and all. Delicious.

                            This book was really challenging for me because the setting was very bleak, the plot sad and the characters terrible. But the writing is amazing as always, Moshfegh never disappoints.

                            It's been a few years of me reading a Witcher book on the 2nd of January, first book fo the new year. I love it because it's the type of fantasy that's very comforting for me, and i relly like Geralt, he's one of my favourite poor little meow meows. This one was nice but a little scarce in plot, a lot of traveling in the woods. Still nice though.
