        <p>
          I'm trying this thing out. Who knows.<br>
          Hello World. That what you say when you start things right? I remember doing countless helloworld.something in class. And I've always loved them; such a sweet sentiment. These days I'm still in school, doing the same old thing and trying to pass the same old exams. I'm getting tired of this charade, pretending everything is working fine, normal administration. Still I try to keep a light on. I would love to start again.<br>
          Hello World.<br>
          <h3>Current Plans:</h3>
          I just created this page and the blog index, and I hope I can make myself follow through for once in my life. I created a little python script to automate a RSS feed for these posts but I think it's pretty useless for this since A: I'm not a writer and B: nobody believes these are going to be anything remotely regular. So I'm thinking to instead make a feed for my "web updates" since that's more reasonable, even if I'll have to maintain the file manually because it's just a single html file. I have not decided yet so for now it stands but idk, let me know what you think.
